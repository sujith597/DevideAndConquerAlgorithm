# DevideAndConquerAlgorithm
A test for how much Divide and Conquer Algorithm faster than normal search for Finding peak.

In this test, Im creating a million random numbers ( in a a linear fasion) and trying to find peak. 
1. Normal search where a <= b >=c way : i.e comparing with adjecent values.
2. Devide and conquer algorithm

Results are shown as given below:

Numbers Generated Successfully
Time taken for generating numbers in milliseconds : 173.8388
Peak Value is :5000000
Time taken for finding peak in simple manner : 33.5504
Peak Value is :5000000
Time taken for finding peak in Devide and Conquer manner : 0.2025


Note : when you checked with less number of values ( i.e 10-100) you can results in reverse manner. i.e normal search is giving result faster. this is because, the logic which we wrote taking bit time.
Numbers Generated Successfully
Time taken for generating 10  numbers in milliseconds : 0.5855
Peak Value is :5
Time taken for finding peak in simple manner : 0.1113
Peak Value is :5
Time taken for finding peak in Devide and Conquer manner : 0.1358
